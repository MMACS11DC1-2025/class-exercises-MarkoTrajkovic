My program will detect if an image has the american flag on it. If around 25-35% of the image is red, and 25-35% of the flag is white, and the remaining colors are blue, my program will determine that it is being show the american flag up close. If the red:white ratio of the flag doesnt match to a margin of 10% of the image, the flag is not american. If there are other bright colors (not including black/grey to attone for shadows) the program will say there is not flag.
